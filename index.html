    <p>ADLM introduces an anchor network that predicts important (e.g., 349 (‘cat’) and 329 (‘dog’)) token mixture of a sequence. These anchored predictions guide a denoiser network to better estimate the likelihoods of <b style="color:gray;">masked (50257)</b> tokens. Here, we illustrate the pathways for tokens: 1760 (‘playing’) and 64 (‘a’). ADLM anchors through important tokens that help narrow the performance gap with autoregressive models.</p>

  <h2 style="text-align:center;">Abstract</h2>
  <p>Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) promise parallel generation and bidirectional context, yet they underperform autoregressive (AR) models in both <em>likelihood modeling</em> and <em>generated text quality</em>. We identify that this performance gap arises when important tokens (e.g., key words or low-frequency words that anchor a sentence) are masked early in the forward process, limiting contextual information for accurate reconstruction. To address this, we introduce the <em>Anchored Diffusion Language Model (ADLM)</em>, a novel two-stage framework that first predicts distributions over important tokens via an anchor network, and then predicts the likelihoods of missing tokens conditioned on the anchored predictions. ADLM significantly improves test perplexity on LM1B and OpenWebText, achieving up to 25.4% gains over prior DLMs, and narrows the gap with strong AR baselines. It also achieves state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot generalization across seven benchmarks and surpasses AR models in MAUVE score, which marks the first time a DLM generates better human-like text than an AR model. Theoretically, we derive an Anchored Negative Evidence Lower Bound (ANELBO) objective and show that anchoring improves sample complexity and likelihood modeling. Beyond diffusion, anchoring boosts performance in AR models and enhances reasoning in math and logic tasks, outperforming existing chain-of-thought approaches.</p>

    <h2>Contributions</h2>
    <ul>      
      <li>We propose ADLM, a novel two-stage diffusion language model that improves the prediction of masked tokens through anchor-guided denoising (§3). We derive an anchored evidence lower bound to train ADLM in an end-to-end fashion, proving improved sample complexity and better likelihood modeling in a DAG model (§4).</li>
      <p></p>
      <li>ADLM achieves lower test perplexities than prior DLMs on LM1B and OWT, narrowing the gap with AR models (§5). Anchoring generalizes better in zero-shot evaluation, improving perplexity on OOD tasks such as PubMed and ArXiv, outperforming both MDLM and AR baselines (§5.1).
      </li>
      <p></p>
      <li>We demonstrate the benefits of anchoring using two different samplers: (a) locked-in (Sahoo et al., 2024) and (b) remasking (Wang et al., 2025a) samplers. With remasking sampler, ADLM outperforms AR models in human-like text generation measured by MAUVE score (§5.1).</li>
      <p></p>
      <li>Beyond diffusion, we integrate our anchoring mechanism into AR models, which leads to a novel reasoner that supplements conventional chain-of-thought. Our results show improvements in nexttoken prediction and supervised fine-tuning on Math (GSM8K (Cobbe et al., 2021)) and logical reasoning (ProntoQA (Saparov & He, 2023) and ProsQA (Hao et al., 2024) (§5.2)) tasks.</li>

    <h2>Experiments: Anchored Diffusion Language Model</h2>
    <h3>Generative Modeling</h3>
    <p>
      Test perplexities (PPL↓) on LM1B and OWT. †Reported in (Sahoo et al., 2024). <strong>Bold: Best diffusion method</strong>. We retrain AR and MDLM to match performance reported in original papers. Our method outperforms previous diffusion language models using the same number of training tokens.

    <p>
      GPT2-Large perplexities (PPL; ↓) on OWT (524B tokens). We evaluate ADLM with the locked-in and remasking samplers each with 1000 steps.

    <h3>Zero-shot Downstream Evaluation</h3>
    <p>
      Zero-shot validation perplexities (↓) of models trained on 524B tokens from OWT. ADLM achieves a new state-of-the-art among diffusion language models and outperforms autoregressive (AR) models on three benchmarks: Lambada, PubMed, and ArXiv. All models use 1024 NFEs.

    <h3>Comparison of Size and Performance</h3>
    <p>
      Generative perplexities evaluated over 1024 unconditional generations using GPT2Large (774M params) as the evaluation model. ADLM significantly outperforms prior masked and diffusion language models under comparable sampling configurations. Notably, it surpasses Plaid (Gulrajani & Hashimoto, 2023) while using only ∼20% of the parameters, and nearly matches the performance of GPT2-medium despite having ∼50M fewer parameters.

  <h3>Standard AR Training</h3>
  <p>Training of standard autoregressive (AR) models. A neural network is trained to predict the next token using causal attention (leftto-right context). All tokens contribute equally to the training loss, and the model treats the sequence uniformly without structural guidance.

  <h2> Out-of-Order Reasoning using Anchored Chain-of-Thought</h2>
  <h3>Supervised Finetuning using Anchor Tokens ([ANT])</h3>
  
  <img class="summary-img" src="./data/acot.png" style="width:90%;"><br>
  
  <h3>Results on Math: GSM8K</h3>
  <p>    
    A key insight from Question 1 is that standard CoT processes the question in a purely left-to-right manner. It computes 16 - 3 - 4 = 9, and then 9 * 2 = 18, following the order in which quantities appear in the question. In contrast, ACoT introduces <code>[ANT]</code> to capture important tokens, which allows it to reason more globally. Specifically, ACoT first computes 3 + 4 = 7 to aggregate all consumption before subtracting from the total (16 - 7 = 9), a pattern more aligned with human intuition. This demonstrates how anchoring enables a “look-ahead” planning behavior, in contrast to the left-to-right decoding bias of standard CoT.

    Examples of logical reasoning tasks with symbolic reasoning traces from ProntoQA (Saparov & He, 2023). Each row shows the input question, groundtruth reasoning trace (CoT), answer, the model’s generated output sequence, and the extracted final answer. CoT, COCONUT, and ACoT share nearly identical training setups, with the only distinction being the use of anchor tokens in ACoT and continuous thoughts in COCONUT. Our model implicitly reasons through anchoring tokens ([ANT]) to infer logical relationships.

  <h2>Samples Generated Using ADLM</h2>

  <p><strong>Sampling Strategy:</strong> Remasking sampler with 4096 sampling steps</p>
  <p><strong>Note:</strong> 
    The generated text demonstrates strong discourse-level coherence, well-structured paragraphs, and natural transitions between topics. For instance, the model begins with a detailed sports commentary and transitions smoothly into a socio-political news report. These shifts are logically segmented with paragraph-level breaks and consistent timelines (e.g., 18:00 PST, 30:00 PST), giving the impression of human-authored journals. This qualitative improvement aligns with the quantitative results reported in Table 3, where ADLM achieves the highest MAUVE score among existing DLMs.

    &lt;|endoftext|&gt; were pretty good in that regard. Dwight Howard chipped in 15 points, and who’s to argue that defense doesn’t deserve a stat of the award?

    Stephen Curry, who was on the floor as soon as I got there, finished with 27 points. Wesley Matthews put in a great effort as well.

    Washington (Curry 30-31, Wall 80-78, Wall 82-7)

    I listened to more of this game than originally planned. The Wizards took control of the game when Otto Porter scored 22 points.

    <strong>Takeaways:</strong>
    The Wizards took control of the game during the first quarter, mostly courtesy of Dennis Schroder and Shaun Livingston. In the second minute, Stephen Curry hit a perfect layup that bounced to the hoop for a dunk, Durant scored two quick points to make it 15-7 with about seven minutes left, and in the third minute Jameer Nelson hit a layup in the corner from range to make it 18-9.

    <strong>18:00 PST</strong>
    Wall and Marcus Thornton each dribbled their way through traffic and made two threes, the first by Andre Drummond with three minutes left to record his 10th career triple-double, and the second by Kevin Durant with five minutes left. However, both shots were blocked at the basket. Kevin Durant missed most of the rest of it with an ankle injury, and Austin Rivers, getting a last-second shot off on him pretty badly, tried to knock the ball down, but couldn’t as the ref just waved it back. Then Rivers shot, then Thornton drove his way in front of Durant, and Wall had to do a reverse dribble move to knock Curry’s first shot free. This was probably the highlight of the game; the defense wasn’t matched with the offense very well against the Thunder from here on out.

    <strong>Halftime:</strong>
    Oklahoma City gave up 10 points for coming up in the final minute, and Zach LaVine came off the bench. In the fourth minute Russell Westbrook ran in a low drive to post up screen while the ball was on the floor, but with 10 seconds left in the game, Zach LaVine stepped onto the floor and slammed the ball in the basket for the bucket.

    <strong>30:00 PST</strong>
    Tony Allen was brought in for Monta Ellis, and he just could not start. He tried his way to the corner for a 3-pointer, but he was shot. Nerlens Noel quickly got up and knocked it back down low, and Allen ran back into the stands of the arena, knocking the ball down high and out of bounds.

    Oklahoma City’s bench never stopped suiting as the game went on. This is a team that is making a leap in the NBA, with DeMarcus Cousins and Chauncey Billups leading the way, and it’s just the right thing to do in such a crazy situation.

    (CN) Hundreds of Seattle residents Tuesday marched to Columbia City to protest the construction of Tesla’s new headquarters in one of the largest nationwide demonstrations in years, as Seattle police clashed with student protesters at a park near Washington State University.

    Thousands of the student marchers gathered at around 2:30 p.m. in Seattle, capital of Western Washington as they confronted riot police carrying rocks, rocks bottles, and gas masks. Large demonstrations of this kind are nearly every weekly in the sprawling city. Tesla CEO Elon Musk said he didn’t know how much the new headquarters could cost him but that it would be enough for the car company to complete its plans. However, the cost estimate is unknown. In the debating point, the city of Seattle, a state infrastructure agency, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority and the thousand-plus protesters wait for a judge’s approval to assess possible damages.

    Tesla’s headquarters is the second-tallest office building proposed in Greater Snohomish County. It is planned on the Seattle Pacific University campus. Tesla also has a 14-story supertall building on Mercer Street that would also include mixed-use office space. There is also construction of a 50,000 square foot garage that is expected to open next year. There is also a parking garage on the 8.7 acre property. No residences are listed in Tesla’s property plan approved by federal agencies.

    Tesla and company officials are expected to have the newest office building at 240,000 square feet made for public access public, once it’s slated for completion. The company is already in court for a waiver that allows it to maintain the building because it is in a park. A lawyer for the company said on April 27 that a judge in Seattle is expected to rule on the waiver, which would allow the building to be enabled. This is one of several lawsuits that have emerged in recent weeks since Tesla’s new headquarters was announced in March. Across the U.S
